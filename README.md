## Introduction

The Spotify Web API Example is a sample project that demonstrates how to interact with the Spotify Web API to access various music-related data. It uses Node.js and the Express framework to create a simple server that provides endpoints to retrieve audio analysis, audio playback details, and music recommendations.

## Features

- Obtain an access token using Spotify Web API's Client Credentials Flow.
- Get audio analysis for a specific music track based on the track ID.
- Retrieve audio playback details for a specific music track based on the track ID.
- Get music track recommendations based on provided seed artists, genres, and tracks.

## Requirements

Before running the application, you need to have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) obtained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENTID=<your_spotify_client_id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENTSECRET=<your_spotify_client_secret>
REDIRECT_URI=<your_redirect_uri>
```

2. Start the server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

3. The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or the PORT you specified in the `.env` file).

## API Routes

1. **GET /get-token** - This route allows you to obtain an access token using the Spotify Web API's Client Credentials Flow.

2. **GET /audio-analysis/:trackId** - This route provides audio analysis for a specific music track based on the given track ID.

3. **GET /audio-playback/:trackId** - This route provides audio playback details for a specific music track based on the given track ID.

4. **GET /recommendations** - This route provides music track recommendations based on seed artists, genres, and tracks.
